This is the NSL (National Species List) Services Application developed at the Australian National Botanic Gardens in
association with CHAH, the ALA and the IBIS team.

== Services

The NSL services provide a relatively generic set of services for searching Names, References and Authors as well as
accessing classification trees of taxons.

The NSL is (and probably always will be) a work in progress, we'll be adding a roadmap and more doco here as we go.

This code is Licensed under the Apache 2 License and we welcome contributions from the taxonomic community.

Please use Github issues for any bug reports.

== Shard ID ranges

For Australian NSL infrastructure we are splitting the ID ranges used across different known shards. This is *not* essential
but it does mean we have a means to discriminate data sources on IDs if somehow we manage to loose track.

The current allocated ranges are:

* Vascular (APNI) 1000 - 10,000,000 + 50,000,001 - 60,000,000
* Moss 10,000,001 - 20,000,000
* Algae 20,000,001 - 30,000,000
* Lichen 30,000,001 - 40,000,000
* DAWR 40,000,001 - 50,000,000 (Aust. Dept. of Agriculture and Water Resources)
* Fungi 60,000,001 - 70,000,000

There is a confluence page for the NSL infrastructure as well at https://www.anbg.gov.au/ibis25/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=NSL&title=NSL+Project+2.0

== Building and Running

This is a standard https://grails.org/[Grails] 3.3.10 project. You can use all the standard grails tasks to build and run
this project. You will need some supporting services i.e.

. A mapper
. postgresql database with the NSL schema loaded
. LDAP with users

TIP: See <<Developing with supporting services>> below for how to get these running for development using the included docker-compose scripts.

To run the services in development mode just run `grails run-app` which will run up the service in it's own tomcat instance
locally. You can also use the gradle task `bootRun` e.g. `./gradlew bootRun`.

The services work nicely within IntelliJ IDEA just import the project.

=== Building and deploying docker image.
To build a war file you can use `grails war` or you can use `./gradlew assemble`. This will build a war file and put it
in the `build/libs` directory.

To publish to docker use the gradle task `./gradlew dockerPublish`. Note you will have to be logged into docker hub to
publish.

WARNING: Note we're currently publishing to `biodiversity/` on docker hub. Change the `dockerRepo` property in the
`gradle.properties` file to your own repository.

NOTE: The docker image runs the services as the nsl_user UID: 5000 GID: 5000 in the container. This user will be mapped
to the host user:group with those IDs. It may be useful to assign a user to that ID in the host, but not essential.

=== Developing with supporting services

We have supplied a docker-compose driven script to run up a mapper and ldap server. Follow thes steps to get it running:

. Install docker, use the docs/docker.adoc document as a guide.
. Make sure the environment variables in the `bin/devel-up.sh` script are correct, mainly that the postgresql port is correct.
. The script will alter your database to make the mapper tables point at "biodiversity.local", So you'll need to add the following
lines to `/etc/hosts` before you run it:

  127.0.0.1 biodiversity.local
  127.0.0.1 id.biodiversity.local

. run the script `bin/devel-up.sh

The script uses docker-compose up to run the mapper and ldap. The LDAP is at port 10389 and the mapper is on port 7070.

WARNING: This exposes the ports on the host machine, so the services won't work if you run them via the included Dockerfile,
as that runs within *another* docker container and doesn't have a network connection/route to the exposed ports.

By default the `grails run-app` or `./gradlew bootRun` will try and use the config file at
`"${projectDir.absolutePath}/etc/nsl/services-config-g3.groovy"` (see build.gradle task bootRun). This expects the

TIP: The LDAP server include has a user called *test* with the password *test* so you can log into the editor and the
services

* database to be at localhost:5432,
* the mapper to be at biodiversity.local:7070
* ldap to be at biodiversity.local:10389
* will create mapper links that point to http://id.biodiversity.local:7070/broker/...

==== Stopping the docker containers

to stop the mapper and ldap run `bin/devel-down.sh`.
