This documents the new data structure development for handling distributions.

== Description

Distribution of named things (taxa) is recorded against tree entries (Tree_element) as part of it's "profile".
Historically this distribution is recorded as free form text that has been tending toward a structured text.

e.g. `Qld (native and naturalised), NSW (native and naturalised), LHI, NI, ACT, Vic, Tas`

The existing text structure can be described as:

 a comma separated list of Regions with an optional modifier in brackets.

The current set of modifiers for APC are:

----
(doubtfully extinct)
(uncertain origin)
(naturalised)
(possibly extinct)
(doubtfully naturalised)
(native and doubtfully naturalised)
(native and uncertain origin)
(presumed extinct)
(native and naturalised)
(native and naturalised and uncertain origin)
(?naturalised)
(formerly naturalised)
(native and formerly naturalised)
----

the current set of Regions for APC are:

----
WA, CoI, ChI, AR, CaI, NT, SA, Qld, CSI, NSW, LHI, NI, ACT, Vic, Tas, HI, MDI, MI
----

== Requirements

We regularly get asked for data that relies on distribution information and importantly on the modifier information. For
example we are asked for counts of native or weed species recorded in a region or regions. 

I have some SQL which currently break down the data as best we can (understanding that some of the text is un parsable)

We would ideally like to be able to have a permanent real time query for this data.

We need to be compatible with GBIF distributions http://rs.gbif.org/extension/gbif/1.0/distribution.xml .

=== Observations

==== multiple concerns

The Distribution data is trying to deal with multiple concerns at different levels. This is made trickier by the lack of
granularity in the data, for example the statement that something (at a species level) is both native and naturalised in
a region doesn't make logical sense, if it is native in NSW then it _is_ native in NSW. What the users are trying to
record is finer grained data within the region, i.e. it is native to parts of NSW but it is naturalised in other parts.
We are not recording the finer grains of information like _where_ it is naturalised or native.

These distinctions are apparently because we need to avoid saying "this wattle is native to Bogsville because Bogsville
is in NSW". Currently the modifiers say native *AND* naturalised, but they should probably just say native "," naturalised,
or even native "or" naturalised?? Maybe not according to Anna Monro because "Normal people we say 'What does that mean?'"

==== composition on higher ranks

Taxa that are _leaf nodes_ on the tree are concrete objects, highter taxons are a grouping, so higher taxon distributions
will be a grouping or aggregation of lower taxa distributions. Put plainly Genus and Family names need a distribution
composed from the distributions of the leaf taxa. e.g.

image::composed-dist.svg[]

You'll note from the example that there are trumping rules where formerly naturalised is trumped by naturalised in another
species when aggregating the modifiers. You'll also note that when a species is just native there is no modifier, but once
combined with naturalised it is explicitly displayed i.e. "Vic" + "Vic (naturalised)" = "Vic (native and naturalised)".

image::additive_states.png[additive states from Anna Monro]

=== Implied/Detailed requirements

. define regions with a sort order (geographic co-ordinates not required)
. regions can only appear once in a distribution.
. define status (i.e. the modifiers) with
.. display order
.. composing rules for display (when creating higher order distributions)
.. combinatorial rules for what modifiers can be combined on leaf taxa e.g. "naturalised and uncertain origin" but not
"naturalised and formerly naturalised"

In Anna's diagram above, it is clear that there is a set of valid or Possible Character States (status). We could just
have each possible state as a modifier i.e. have separate state for each combination, but that would make composition at
higher taxa harder and searching harder e.g.

composing: "native and naturalised" + "formerly naturalised" -> just "native and naturalised"

composing: native + naturalised + native and uncertain origin + formerly naturalised + doubtfully naturalised ->
native and naturalised and uncertain origin

NOTE: Anna and Kirsten point out that distribution for variety and species may be different so composing the species will
not work. So we would only compose distribution of Genus and Above. We will also only compose distribution on Genus and
Family. Need to check the species includes the distribution of children.

Searching for native if we have "native and something" means we need to flag the concept of native in each state or just
know to include all the "native and..." states.

By separating out the states to single concerns, then combining them as needed,
composition and searching  will be simpler (90% usecase), displaying the composed state as a string will be "meh", and
combinatorial rules will need some magic. Searching for separated states is then effectively a flag operation:

 find all taxa with the state "native" and region "NSW"

or

 find all taxa with the state "naturalised" and not state "native" in all regions.

Combinatorial rules could defined as a many to many link table between states. Each entry is a valid combination, which
is modeling a list of valid states you can combine with. Let's try it:

. presumed extinct
. doubtfully naturalised
.. native
. formerly naturalised
.. native

. naturalised
.. native
.. uncertain origin

. native
.. naturalised
.. formerly naturalised
.. doubtfully naturalised
.. uncertain origin

. uncertain origin
.. native
.. naturalised

If we treat the sub items on the list as things you can combine with but you can only make combinations where all elements
can combine with all other elements...

We can combine:

* native and doubtfully naturalised
* native and naturalised and uncertain origin

We can't combine:

* native and naturalised and doubtfully naturalised - because naturalised doesn't contain doubtfully naturalised
* anything with "presumed extinct"

==== GBIF Distribution Extension to Darwin Core

Niels Klazenga pointed out we need to support the http://rs.gbif.org/extension/gbif/1.0/distribution.xml[GBIF Distribution Extension to Darwin Core.]

The relevant fields from that are:

* http://rs.gbif.org/areas/[LocationId] - just map our regions to TDWG maybe? Better still store the geojson shape reference.
* locality - Long form of region abbreviation e.g. New South Wales
* countryCode - AU
* http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/occurrence_status.xml[occurrenceStatus] ...
** present: `There is at least one well documented record of the taxons presence in the area.`
** common: `Subclass of present: Species observed frequently in most proper habitat.`
** rare: `Subclass of present: Species occurs regularly, but in small numbers. Requires careful searching of proper habitat.`
** irregular: `Subclass of present: May be common in certain years and entirely absent other years.`
** doubtful: `The taxon is scored as being present in the area but there is some doubt over the evidence. The doubt may
be of different kinds including taxonomic or geographic imprecision in the records.`
** absent: `There is evidence to document the absence of a taxon in the area. An extinct organism is absent while its
establishmentMeans is native.`
** excluded: `Subclass of absent: The organism is reported insome (gray) literature for a certain region, but is is
erroneous. Reason for exclusion could be a misidentification, an old report, a simple publishing mistake or any other or unknown reason.`
* http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/iucn/threat_status.xml[threatStatus] ...
** Extinct
** Extinct in the Wild
** Regionally Extinct - **APC current use of presumed extinct?** however this term uses "when there is no reasonable doubt that ..."
** Critically Endangered
** Endangered
** Vulnerable
** Near Threatened
** Least Concern
** Data Deficient
** Not Applicable
** Not Evaluated
* http://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/establishment_means.xml[establishmentMeans] ...
** native: `A species that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in
a particular region or ecosystem. The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (for example, native to New England).`
** introduced: `A species introduced with human help (intentionally or accidentally) to a new place or new type of habitat
where it was not previously found. Not all non-native species are invasive. In fact, when many non-native species are
introduced to new places, they cannot reproduce or spread readily without continued human help (for example, many ornamental plants).`
** naturalised: `Subclass of introduced: The organism reproduces naturally and forms part of the local ecology.`
** invasive: `Subclass of introduced: The organism is having a deleterious impact on another organism, multiple organisms or the ecosystem as a whole.`
** managed: `Subclass of introduced: The organism maintains its presence through intentional cultivation or husbandry.`
** uncertain: `Origin of organism is uncertain`
* source: (APC would use CHAH ref?) `Source reference for this distribution record. Can be proper publication citation, a webpage URL, etc.`
* occurrenceRemarks: `Comments or notes about the distribution e.g. "Excluded because of misidentification"`
* http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#datasetID[datasetID] - e.g. http://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/APC **note we don't have a dataset identifier**

== Structure

Each tree element will be linked to a set of distribution entries, via a link table, which will contain a region and a
set of status entries.

Only the valid set of distribution entry combinations will be started as distribution entries.

----

The above query provides a view of tree_elements that are native in a region, and provides a set of flags that indicate
it is native within that region. This makes a good view for querying. and we could provide separate views

```
id,simple_name,wa,coi,chi,ar,cai,nt,sa,qld,csi,nsw,lhi,ni,act,vic,tas,hi,mdi,mi
51211639,Boryaceae,true,false,false,false,false,true,false,true,false,true,false,false,false,true,false,false,false,false
```

NOTE: I have extended VQ to allow it to call specific functions so the following queries may be used.

That function in VQ allows us to quickly answer most questions about distribution and status for the apc. Generic
functions for any tree are possible, but splitting out the regions is trickier as they're not static.


=== update and import

== Implementation

=== Issues

==== editing old distributions
Currently we allow "minor edits" to distribution (and comments) where old entries can have typos etc fixed. We record
the old and the new distribution and have a reason for the edit recorded.

If we do a minor edit to distribution it will change the distribution, but we'll need to just record the distribution
string in the profile. I don't think that is a problem, but it means we'd need an editing interface implemented for
historic distributions.
