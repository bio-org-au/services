This documents the process of merging a version of the tree with another version

== Why?

If you have two draft copies of a tree and you make changes to one then publish that draft, the second draft will
not contain the changes made to the currently published tree. That is, the second draft will be "behind" the published
tree.

If the second draft is published without updates it will overwrite the changes of the first draft, so they will "revert"
back to the previous version.

To fix this, when a draft is published, remaining drafts need to "Pull" or "Merge" the changes on the newly published
tree with their drafts.

== Usage

When the editor of a draft tries to publish a draft that came from an older version than the currently published version
they will be blocked and asked to merge changes from the published tree first. They would be presented with a diff of
the two versions showing simple updates and "clashes".

* A simple update is one that does not overwrite a change made in the draft.
* A clash is an update that would overwrite changes made in the draft.

Non-conflicting updates would be automatically made to the draft. Conflicting updates would require to user to decide
what to do:

1. Accept the published changes, overwriting the draft changes.
2. Reject the published changes, effectively overwriting the published changes.
3. Merge the changes from both the published and draft versions.

=== Simplifications to get it happening

Merging the changes will initially be the same as Rejecting the published changes where the user will have to manually
copy the the changes across to their version.

*Ideally* (which means probably *later*) we should try to merge all non clashing changes, e.g. if the published tree has a
change to the comment and the draft has a change to distribution then the merge should just add the comment and leave
the distribution change.

=== Complications

Changes in synonymy will show up in altered synonymy reports and can be applied to any draft at any time. The services
code should choose and re-use identical tree elements and remove orphaned elements as you go but minor changes (such as
double spaces in comments) can cause an inconsequential change to be recorded. It may be wise to implement some form
of clean up for inconsequential changes such as double spaces which don't show up in the HTML output.

== Implementation

=== Working out if we're behind the published tree

Each draft has a previous version id which points to the version it was created from. If this is not the currently
published tree version then we are behind the "Head". It shouldn't matter how far behind the head we are we can Diff
from the previous version to the current version to work out what has changed and apply the changes to the draft.

When we're happy that we have caught up with (merged) all the changes we want, we reset the previous version on the draft
to the Head, or currently published tree.

=== Tracking a merge

Since it may take a little while for the user to go through the changes and decide what to do while merging we probably
need a way to track where the user is up to. Where we're accepting changes from the published version we can just apply
as we go and those changes will drop off the list.

WARNING: Is there a batching up requirement for accept?.

So we only need to track what changes we are happy with, that is changes we want to keep. This will include rejection of
the published changes and merged changes (which are still just changes from the currently published changes.

We will add a flag to tree version element, which isn't copied to new versions, to indicate that any difference to the
published tree has been accepted by the user. In fact this should be inverted as a conflict flag set when a merge conflict
is detected. When the conflict is resolved the flag is reset. This will help find unresolved conflicts, which is what we
really want.

Since subsequent published tree changes will only contain elements that have changed since the last
published tree, we only need to set the conflict flag on each merge check.

=== Changes to consider

We could just compare the currently published tree to the draft and show the diff, however that will show changes that
have been made in the draft that the owner of the draft clearly wants, and therefore that would be _noise_.

So we really just want consider the set of changes made between the previous version (currently set on the draft version)
and the published version. Lets call this the *head change set*

From that set we want to compare to our draft. The diff between the previous version and the draft, which
we will call the *draft change set*, can be compared with the *head change set* to work out *conflicting changes* and
*non-conflicting changes*.

* If the tree version element for a name is in the draft and head change sets it is a conflicting change.
* If the tree version element for a name is only in the head change set it is a non-conflicting change.
* If the tree version element for a name is only in the draft change set it can be ignored.

=== Conflicting changes

==== Accept published

Accepting the published changes, overwriting the draft changes is effectively the diff *Revert* function. Diff revert
compares the draft against published and allows you to revert a change to the currently published version. Revert is not
yet implemented, so it may make sense to implement that first?

WARNING: Technical Content

To revert a change we change the tree_element_id on the tree_version_element - this can be done with the existing
`treeServices.changeElement()` which

* replaces the tree version element
* updates the child tree paths
* updates the parent ID of child tree version elements
* and deletes the old tree version element

Implementing Revert gives us both a revert for current diff changes and the Accept published changes per change, so the
user could individually pick updates to accept.

It can then be used as the basis for a bulk update from published by identifying draft elements that changed between the
previously published version and the current published version.

==== Reject published changes, use this version.

To use the draft changes over the published changes we simply ignore the published change. Once we have set the previous version
to the currently published tree we're done. While merging the user will reject the published change clearing the conflict
flag on the Tree Version Element.

=== Non-conflicting changes

Non conflicting changes from the *head change set* should be automatically applied on merge. Initially we'll just list the
changes briefly in the merge report.

== Testing

We need to devise a good set of tests for merge.
